We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shyin' away
I'll be comin' for your love, okay?

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

[Verse 2]
So, needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumblin' away
Slowly learnin' that life is okay
Say after me
"It's no better to be safe than sorry"

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

[Verse 3]
All the things that you say
Yeah, is it life or just to play
My worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shyin' away
I'll be comin' for you anyway

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

[Outro]
(Take on me) (Take on me)
(Take me on) (Take on me)
I'll be gone (Take on me) (Take on me)
In a day (Take me on) (Take on me)
(Take on me) (Take on me)
(Take me on) (Take on me)
(Take on me)
